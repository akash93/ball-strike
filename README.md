This is a small sample game built using the Cocos2D-X framework. 

# Instructions
 - Clone the repo 
 - Compile the project for the specific platform  using `cocos compile -p platform_name`
 - Run it on the appropriate device/emulator


* If you wish to compile for android-studio it is recommended that you set `org.gradle.daemon=true` inside `gradle.properties` to speed up build times.
